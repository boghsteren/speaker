This is the repo for speakerlist, a simple tool for managing speaker order at meetings. Users can use a simple ID to connect to the list and see it displayed on their browser, add themselves or remove themselves from the speaker order.

It is built using pusher-js, create-react-app, express, axios and Evergreen UI.
